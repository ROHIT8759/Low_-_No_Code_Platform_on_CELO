# How to Add Your Developer Photo

To display your photo in the "About the Developer" section:

1. **Add your photo** to the `public` folder with the name `developer-photo.jpg`

   - Recommended size: 800x800 pixels (square)
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - File path: `/public/developer-photo.jpg`

2. The placeholder currently shows your initials "RK" with instructions

3. Once you add the photo, update line 605 in `app/page.tsx`:

**Replace this:**

```tsx
<div className="w-48 h-48 mx-auto mb-6 rounded-full bg-gradient-to-br from-cyan-500 to-fuchsia-500 flex items-center justify-center text-6xl font-bold text-white shadow-2xl group-hover:scale-110 transition-transform">
  RK
</div>
<p className="text-slate-400 text-sm">
  📸 Upload your photo to: <br/>
  <code className="text-cyan-400">/public/developer-photo.jpg</code>
</p>
```

**With this:**

```tsx
<img
  src="/developer-photo.jpg"
  alt="Rohit Kumar Kundu - CELO Builder Developer"
  className="w-48 h-48 mx-auto mb-6 rounded-full object-cover border-4 border-cyan-500/50 shadow-2xl group-hover:scale-110 transition-transform"
/>
```
